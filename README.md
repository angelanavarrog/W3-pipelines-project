# Project: Data Pipeline

## Ojective

The goal of this project is to find a dataset and enlarge the information it provices with information obtained through an API or Web Scrapping by using different technigues, as functions or pandas, among others.

## Procedure

For this purpose, I have selected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) a data set about [Airbnb in NYC in 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).

Once I had chosen it, I proceeded to clean by deleting columns and grouping information by neighborhood I obtained a [cleaned dataset](https://github.com/angelanavarrog/W3-pipelines-project/blob/master/Other%20relevant%20files/Cleaning.ipynb).

After that, I scrapped the information from this [wesbite](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoodpop.htm) obtaining a [new dataset](https://github.com/angelanavarrog/W3-pipelines-project/blob/master/Other%20relevant%20files/Scraping.ipynb).

The reason that made me select it, was the intention or analyze if there is any relationship between the location of Airbnb's apartments and the population of NYC neighborhood.

## Conclusion

After analyze the selected data sets, could we establish some kind of relationship between the location of the apartments and the most populated areas of New York City?
